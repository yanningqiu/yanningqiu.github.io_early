Hello!

I am a PhD candidate studying restoration ecology at Wageningen University, the Netherlands. I use a combination of field surveys, mathematical modelling and remote sensing to explore the restoration potentials in drylands, with [Milena Holmgren](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/milena-dr.-m-milena-holmgren-urba.htm) and [Zhiwei Xu](https://sgos.nju.edu.cn/xzw12/list.htm).

My PhD project specifically focuses on the restoration in the Chinese sand dunes, a representative dryland systems in China. My work seeks to bridge two distinct disciplines of ecology, i.e. theoretical ecology and restoration ecology, to better inform restoration potentials as well as develop suitable planting and monitoring strategies that promote ecological resilience.

Besides scientific research, I am also interested in environmental policies and applying research outputs into practice. I did my master internship at United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, East and North-East Asia office, Incheon, Republic of Korea, which my main duty was on-desk research about the environmental policies tackling Land Degradation and Desertification issues in North-East Asian countries. I have also been actively participating in scientific consultancy voluntary work with a few famous Chinese NGOs including SEE Foundation, Shanshui Conservation center, Chinese Felid Conservation Alliance.

In my daily life I enjoy photography (especially wildlife photography), bird watching, skiing and trekking.
